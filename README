#File Store Service

The File Store Service is a simple HTTP server and command-line client that allows you to store, manage, and interact with plain-text files. The server is built using Flask, and the client is implemented in Python. 
Text files have been provided to test where text1.txt and same_text1.txt have same content, to check if they can copy content without sending to server.

## Features

- Add files to the store
- List files in the store
- Remove files from the store
- Update file contents in the store
- Word count of all files in the store
- Retrieve most frequent words in the files

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Pip package manager
- Docker (optional, for running the application in containers)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Start the server:
python app.py

This will start the Flask server on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. Use the help command for any extra information:
python client.py --help


This will display the available commands and options for the CLI client.

3. Examples of CLI commands:
- Add files to the store:
  ```
  python client.py add file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

- List files in the store:
  ```
  python client.py ls
  ```

- Remove a file from the store:
  ```
  python client.py rm file.txt
  ```

- Update the contents of a file in the store:
  ```
  python client.py update file.txt
  ```

- Get the word count of all files in the store:
  ```
  python client.py wc
  ```

- Retrieve the most frequent words:
  ```
  python client.py freq-words --limit 10 --order dsc
  ```

4. Access the server API directly:
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:5000`
- Available API routes:
  - `POST /add` - Add files to the store
  - `GET /ls` - List files in the store
  - `POST /rm/<filename>` - Remove a file from the store
  - `POST /update/<filename>` - Update the contents of a file in the store
  - `GET /wc` - Get the word count of all files in the store
  - `GET /freq-words` - Retrieve the most frequent words

## Docker

You can also run the File Store Service using Docker. If you have Docker installed, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:
docker build -t file-store-service .

2. Run the Docker container:
docker run -p 5000:5000 file-store-service

This will start the Flask server inside a Docker container.
